Coding question - Triplets

Given a log file of user_id, timestamp & page visited find the 10 most common triplets, where a triplet is an occurrence of 3 pages visited sequentially by the same user.

Tips

We are looking to see how the candidate writes code, so they should choose the language they are most familiar with and write code that is readable and maintainable.

If the candidate thinks this is some massively parallel log parsing / analysis problem, tell them it's just for one log file and that they can assume that the data fits in memory.

If they try to do the math to figure out how many unique combinations there might be, it's ok (and counts as a bonus for the candidate), but don't let them dwell on this for too long.

We are not looking for them to write a sort algorithm, so if they want to use any off-the-shelf sorting to get the top 10, it is acceptable.

They can also create some data structure to keep track of the top 10, and that's also acceptable.

Quedo a la espera de tu respuesta.
Saludos!
